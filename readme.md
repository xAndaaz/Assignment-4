# Assignment-4
This project conducts an in-depth Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on the Titanic dataset, loaded via sns.load_dataset('titanic'), using matplotlib, seaborn, and scipy to uncover passenger and survival patterns. I explored data distributions, missing values, outliers, and variable relationships through visualizations like histograms, box plots, heatmaps, bar plots, a stacked bar plot, and a pairplot. I engineered a family_size feature (sibsp + parch + 1) to analyze family impact on survival and performed a t-test to confirm a significant age difference between survivors and non-survivors (p-value < 0.05). The missing value heatmap highlighted extensive deck missingness (75%+) and moderate age gaps (20%), guiding potential imputation. Histograms revealed skewed age (peak 20â€“30) and fare (high outliers >500), while box plots flagged outliers like ages over 65 and fares above 100. The correlation heatmap showed a weak fare-sibsp link (0.16), and bar plots confirmed higher survival for females (70%) and Class 1 (60%). The stacked bar plot quantified survival rates (e.g., 95% for Class 1 females), and the pairplot suggested lower fare and age favored survival. Statistical summaries (median age 28, mean fare 32.20) and outlier counts (11 ages >64.81, 116 fares >65.63) added rigor. Outputs include high-quality PNGs and text files, presented in a Python script, showcasing my data analysis skills for a compelling portfolio piece.
